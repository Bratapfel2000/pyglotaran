Introduction
============

Pyglotaran is python library for global target analysis. It is aimed to be
user-friedly and provide state of the art global target analysis to researchers.

It's features are:

* user-friendly modelling with a custom yml based modelling language
* parameter optimization varbiale projection and non-linear least-squares
* easily extendable modelling framework
* battle-hardened model and algorithms for fluorescence dynamics
* build upon and fully integrated in the standart Python science stack (NumPy,
  SciPy, Jupyter)
