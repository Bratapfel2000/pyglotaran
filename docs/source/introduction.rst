Introduction
============

Pyglotaran is python library for global target analysis. It is aimed to be
user-friedly and provide state of the art global target analysis to researchers.

It's features are:

* user-friendly modelling with a custom yml based modelling language
* parameter optimization varbiale projection and non-linear least-squares
* easily extendable modelling framework
* battle-hardened model and algorithms for fluorescence dynamics
* build upon and fully integrated in the standart Python science stack (NumPy,
  SciPy, Jupyter)

A Note To Glotaran Users
------------------------

Although closely related and developed in the same lab, pyglotaran is not a
replacement for Glotaran - A GUI For TIMP. Pyglotaran only aimes to provide
modelling and optimization algorithms.

The 'user-interface' for pyglotaran is Jupyter Notebook. It is desinged to
seamlessly integrate in this enviroment and be compatible with all major
visualization and data analysis tools in the scientific python enviroment.

If you are a non-technical user, you should give this tools a try, there are
numerous tutorials how to use them. You don't need to really learn to program.
If you can use e.g. Matlab or Mathematica, you can use Jupyter and Python.
